      summary: COIN-OR branch and cut (Cbc)
      description: |
        Cbc (Coin-or branch and cut) is an open-source mixed integer linear
        programming solver written in C++. It can be used as a callable library or
        using a stand-alone executable. It can be called through AIMMS (through the
        AIMMSlinks project), AMPL (natively), CMPL, GAMS (through the GAMSlinks
        project), JuMP, Mathematica, MiniZinc, MPL (through the CoinMP project), PuLP,
        Python (e.g., cbcpy), and OpenSolver for Excel, among others.
